## TL;DR

* Googleâ€™s political bias has equated the freedom from offense with psychological safety,
but shaming into silence is the antithesis of psychological safety.
* This silencing has created an ideological echo chamber where some ideas are too
sacred to be honestly discussed.
* The lack of discussion fosters the most extreme and authoritarian elements of this
ideology.
* Extreme: all disparities in representation are due to oppression
* Authoritarian: we should discriminate to correct for this oppression
* Differences in distributions of traits between men and women may in part explain why we
don't have 50% representation of women in tech and leadership.
* Discrimination to reach equal representation is unfair, divisive, and bad for business.

## Biases

Left|Right
----|-----
Compassion for weak | Respect for the strong/authority
Disparities are due to injustices | Disparities are natural and just 
Humans are inherently cooperative | Humans are inherently competitive
Change is good (unstable) | Change is dangerous (stable)
Open | Closed
Idealist | Pragmatic
constant change | slow to react
over diversify | overly hierarchical
overly trust employees and competitors | untrusting of others

* Netiher is 100% correct
* Both are necessary for functioning society

## Biological causes of gender gap in tech

### Women vs Men
* openness directetd towards feelings and aesthetics rather than ideas
* interst in people rather than things
* cooperative vs. competitive
* empathizing vs. systemizing
* gregarious and agreeable vs. assertive
* neurotic
* work-life balance vs. drive for status

* men gender role is currently inflexible

## Google's biases

* Programs, mentoring and classes only for people with a certain gender or race
* High priority queue and special treatment for "diversity" candidates
* Hiring practices lower the bar for "diversity" candidates by decresing the false negative rate
* Reconsider any people not "diverse" enough not showing scrunity in the reverse direction
* Setting org level OKRs for increased representation = illegal discrimination

Conclusion

* can increase race and gender tensions
* Not morally and economically correct 
* No scientific evidence
* Veiled left ideology

Reasons

* Humanities and social science (and Google) lean left
* Social constructionism and gender wage gap are myth
* Humans are biased toward protecting females (because female are more cooperative and agreeable than men)
* Man labelled as a misogynist and whiner (if complains about gender issue)
* Every difference between men and women interpreted as form of women's oppression

## Suggestions

* Treat people as individuals
* De-moralize diversity
* Stop alienating conservatives
  -> Conservatives tend to be higher in conscientiousness
* Confront biases
  -> Break down Googlegeist scores by political orientation and personality (to show biases)
* Stop restricting programs and classes to certain genders and races
* Discussion about costs and benefits of diversity programs
* Focus on psychological safety
* De-emphasize emphaty
  -> focus on anectodes = more biases
  -> emotionally unengaged = better reason about facts
* Proritize intention
  -> microaggression training incorrectly equates speech with violence (not backed by evidence)
* Openness about science of human nature
  -> not all differences are socially constructed
* Make Unconscious Bias training mandatory for promo committies
  -> potential for overcorrecting or backslash
  -> more other biases besides stereotypes
